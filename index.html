  	<h3>Every 3rd Wednesday</h3>
        <p>We meet once a month to share our knowledge and experiences to learn and discuss how to improve collaboration between teams and leverage automation to build better businesses. Typically our meetings last 1-2 hours, and are centered around talks that show off new tool, techniquess and companies journeys. Topics generally flow into open discussion at the end. </p>
        <p>This is a group targeted to engineers (both dev and ops), tech professionals, managers, leads, architects and entrepreneurs coming together to learn about and share information on DevOps processes, tools, practices and benefits.</p>
        <p>We maintain a welcoming and friendly group for everyone. Please read our <a href="https://github.com/sddevops/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a></p>
